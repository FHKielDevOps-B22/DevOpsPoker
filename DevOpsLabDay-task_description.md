# DevOps Lab Day 10.6.2017

Today you are asked to enhance an already existing Poker Bot. The Bot is written in Python. It registers at a game server and is called during an automated Poker Game which runs every second. The Bot returns a bid depending on various parameters like hand cards, community cards, maximum and minimum bid.
You need to organize your team for efficiency to continuously improve the bot and deploy frequently into production. Make sure you choose individual roles according to your individual skills. The Game Server displays the current win and loss of all teams. The winner is the team who won most points at the end of the lab day. Use the teamwork methods you have learned during lectures in addition to the already scheduled retrospectives.
To start you need a GitHub account for your team to work on your project. Fork the project from:


    https://github.com/connor21/DevOpsPoker

The project contains a documentation with usage instructions.
Your goal is to win the game. There is no one-way! So there is no need for cheating or looking what the other teams are doing. You can use the internet. We wish you all good luck!
